Write a short case study (150â€“200 words) about a growth consultant who helped a company with a stalling product by diagnosing gaps in go-to-market (GTM) execution. The consultant should talk to the founder and team about challenges in finishing tasks, discover that transparency and reliability were the missing links, and design short exercises that build mutual understanding and trust. Highlight how this increased transparency resulted in measurable impact: for example, a 12% reduction in excess inventory within one quarter, freeing up $50,000 in working capital. Emphasize how this small win gave the company breathing room to reinvest in growth, boosted delegation, clarified roles, improved pricing confidence, and removed other bottlenecks. Make sure to show the human side of this win, not just the numbers.
