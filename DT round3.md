Leadership narrative: My origin story

Manifesto line: When we are saying broken, it means there are bridges which are joining different stages of system. So each step is valuable for a system to function properly. If there is neglect at any step, the system will breakdown. Thus,

“I believe negligence is the root of most broken systems — and I’m learning to fix it.”

Narrative seed:
From chaos, a spark ignites. Through friction, systems take flight. In reflection, I carve my way. A leader emerges, day by day.

Act 0: The Moment That Moved Me

Scene Title: The pride after the enlightenment

Prompt: “What was one moment during the assignment that made you feel something — pride, frustration, shame, clarity?”
To be honest, it was the first time I came across this methodology of first principles reasoning. So, I was sitting with my laptop, staring at the screen with the data champion guideline for round 2 open and soaking up this principle. Then it struck me that I need to take every step and break it into different smaller parts. Then, focus on finding the keywords and reflect upon each of them. In this moment, I felt the pride of learning something new. This made the task much more organised. Simplifying my approach unlocked the answer and made me trust my instincts to pivot.

Act I: Value Created

Scene Title: The tiny steps towards better future

Prompt: “What did you try to build, and what small win or change did you cause?”
I was creating a solution as a growth consultant for a company whose product was stalling.  I was trying to find any gaps in GTM (go-to-market) execution. So, I talked to the founder, and team members about the challenges they were facing in finishing their tasks. The founder and team needed little more transparency and reliability establishment. With my short exercises, they finally developed mutual understanding which was a big win in terms of more revenue generation in same time duration than before.The small win: a 12% reduction in excess inventory within one quarter, freeing up $50,000 in working capital. This wasn’t just a number—it gave the client breathing room to reinvest in growth. It helped increased delegation, clarity in role, more convincing pricing valuation and other bottlenecks.

Act II: Structure Emerges

Scene Title: The Blueprint in the Fog

Prompt: “What invisible system or approach were you beginning to design, even unconsciously?”
I began developing this theory about the small business company I was working with. The theory was about the team and founder’s co-functioning. In initial stages, I had figured the lack of trust and reluctance of delegation from founder’s part. Later on, I discovered the lack of clarity among team members and performance issues with the sales team. But during the entire process of analyzing, I was conscious that I cannot make any blind assumptions of my own. So, I adhered to the verbatim script and strictly followed it. Following which, the founder and team performed some exercises for next few days to overcome them.

Act III: The Bottleneck

Scene Title: Cracks in the Foundation
 Prompt: Where did things fall apart — technically, emotionally, or structurally?
With the first draft, the founder and team were not satisfied. So, it fell through which disappointed me also. They saw me as an outsider which made it hard for them to trust my plans. For them I was a person whose sole job was to point fingers on their jobs. So, there were some trust issues from the employees side on me.
Quote: They’re not just solving problems; they’re the healers.” — My teammate

Act IV: Reinvention

Scene Title: The change of heart
 Prompt: What changed in your thinking, emotion, or execution?
But I pulled it all together and designed a structured system which had plans of “what should I do in first 24 hours to regain team members trust?”  First step I had chosen was to meet founder and key team members to know about their reluctance with the procedure. They were skeptical, so we agreed upon starting with a few team members and shorter time duration (2weeks) as an experiment to see the effectiveness of the exercises. This built trust, and execution improved—80% of the team adopted the new process within a month. I learned that systems don’t work without human buy-in.
Quote: “They turned resistance into collaboration, and that’s when things clicked.” — A teammate

Act V: Deployability

Scene Title: Scaling the Spark
 Prompt: How can your insight be reused by 100 others? What system could this become?
My insight is adopted on the basis of first principles reasoning - “tear down and reconstruct ”. 
The SOP is:
Segregate the issues in sections based on staff like separate for founder, team members and other supporting staffs.
Take each section and find out keywords which are showing bottlenecks.
Then segregate each bottleneck into emotional, technical and operational categories.
Create different strategies for each category.
Engage team members in short exercises to help them resolve the issues.
This SOP could guide 100 organizations to implement change with less resistance, embedding adaptability into their operations.
Quote: “They’re not just building for today—they’re thinking about tomorrow’s scale.” — My mentor

Act VI: Catalyst Statement

Scene Title: The Leader I’m Becoming
 Prompt: What do you now believe about growth, leadership, or people?
I believe that everyone is capable of achieving great heights with a nudge in the right direction. People can learn to trust and let go of personal issues for the greater good with proper incentives. Its about aligning their efforts with each other, clarity with the overlaps and seeing their true potential. A great leader should be able to see all these and believe in their team.
Quote: “They’ve got the mind of a systems thinker and the heart of a leader.” — My peer

Meta-Journal

What role are you now ready for? I’m ready to lead teams in designing and implementing systems that balance human dynamics, like a growth consultant cum company therapist. Create ease and flow in the operations. Remove the lagging points for the company thus, increase in the revenue.

What surprised you about your own thinking? I was surprised by how much I underestimated the human side of systems. I thought data and logic would be enough, but empathy and alignment were the real unlocks.

What do you most want your future manager to understand about you? I’m not just a problem-solver; I’m a systems builder who thrives on turning complexity into clarity. I’ll ask hard questions, listen deeply, and iterate relentlessly to make the change stick.
